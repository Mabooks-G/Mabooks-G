### 🎓 About Me

I'm an **Computer Engineering** student at the **University of Pretoria**, currently working towards my **Bachelor of Engineering degree**.  
I’ve recently explored the **core principles of engineering** and applied them through hands-on projects in both **software** and **electronics** domains.

Outside of academics and coding:

🏊‍♂️ &nbsp;I enjoy **swimming** with friends  
📺 &nbsp;I'm an **anime enthusiast** (Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, and One Piece are among my favorites)  
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 &nbsp;I value **family time** and balance between technology and personal life
